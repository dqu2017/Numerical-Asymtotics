Coherent intertwiner floder has two folders for two distinct critical points. 
For each critical point folder, we use the boundary.nb to obtain the boundary data and corresponding critical point data; 
The boundary and critical point data are saved in savedBoundary.wl file.
The file Asymp.nb is the main code to expand the EPRL-amplitude with coherent intertwiner as the boundary.

Coherent spin network floder is used to expand the EPRL-amplitude with coherent spin network as the boundary

The haar measure we used in the paper can be found in measure_calculation.nb
